# MVGCVAE

**Enhancing Microbe-Disease Association Prediction via Multi-View Graph Convolution and Latent Feature Learning**

# Dataset

1. Disbiome
   Disbiome is a manually curated database that collects published associations between human diseases and microbiome composition changes. It includes information on microbes enriched or depleted in various diseases.
2. HMDAD
   HMDAD (Human Microbe-Disease Association Database) is a benchmark dataset that contains experimentally verified associations between microbes and human diseases, commonly used for model training and evaluation.
3. Peryton
   Peryton is a large-scale dataset integrating human microbiome-disease associations across multiple body sites. It provides high-quality curated data suitable for deep learning and network-based prediction tasks.
